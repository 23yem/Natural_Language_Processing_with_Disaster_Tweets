Welcome! These are some of my notebooks on Kaggle. I made so many notebooks because each notebook is dedicated to a seperate experiment.

For example, roberta-michael.ipynb was for testing out the RoBERTa model. And the disaster-tfrecord-michael.ipynb was for trying out tfrecord. 

The notebook titles can get messy, but that's how I named them on Kaggle at the time.

At the top of each notebook, I'll try my best to explain what experiment each notebook was trying. So for each notebook, look at the top Kernel.

Have fun reading my notebooks!
